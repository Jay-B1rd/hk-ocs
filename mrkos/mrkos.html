                <p>
                    Mrkos took after his father. He always did. That's what everyone told him. He looked liked his father, he acted like his father, he wanted to be his father. It didn't matter that he never met the man in the first place. 

                        <br><br>

                    His father had been a captain of the City Guard, and so Mrkos would be one too. His father had done well in his formal education, as well as in combat training, and so it was Mrkos's duty to follow in his steps. He had to help his mother and his younger siblings. It never occurred to him to try to choose another path. He was content following in the path of his father, even if his mother struggled to look at him. 

                        <br><br>

                    "Your father died protecting the citizens of the city," Mrkos's mother whispered to him. He knew that she believed Mrkos would follow him in every step he took, including the ones that ended in his death. 

                        <br><br>

                    Though he found joy in combat, he found little satisfaction in his duty of protection. His successes waned, and when Mrkos tried to become captain of the guard, he failed. For the first time, he hadn't managed to follow in his father's footsteps, and a seed of bitterness planted within him began to sprout.

                        <br><br>

                    It was difficult to provide for his mother and siblings, even as his younger sister began selling her artwork to assist him. She was a natural prodigy, of course, but it couldn't replace the paycheck that came with being a captain of the City Guard. When his father had lived, he had been considered a noble, due to both his high ranking and his paycheck, but Mrkos had failed in acquiring that same position. They had to move out of their house, into a smaller building with shitty neighbors and a worse neighborhood. With every reminder of his lost privilege, Mrkos's bitterness grew. 

                        <br><br>

                    Then his mother died. She was getting older, but she hadn't quite reached the age that would have made it felt like it was just her time. Without his mother's paycheck to pay the bills, Mrkos had to downsize again in the interest of his two younger siblings. His sister wanted to go to art school, and his brother desperately wanted to join the Archives in Fog Canyon, and Mrkos couldn't afford either one, let alone both.

                        <br><br>

                    When a burglar offered him money to look the other way, he took it. 

                        <br><br>

                    Just once, he told himself. Just to add to the savings. But then it happened again, and again, and then it was pretty clear that criminals were <i>searching out</i> Mrkos specifically to have him help them get away with their crimes.

                        <br><br>

                    And Mrkos... didn't care. What did the people of the city offer him for his protection? Not even a thanks, after hours standing guard in the rain. A shitty paycheck and no raise after years of service. A dead father and a dead mother, with two siblings that dreamed of better lives. It was Mrkos's duty to provide for his siblings, and he could care less about the rest of them.

                        <br><br>

                    A noble named Graedric had recently come under fire for treating his workers as disposable, and that meant Mrkos was raking in cash as he swept evidence under the rug. He didn't care much about any of it, at least not until he witnessed a mayfly cornered by one of the so-called "vigilantes" that despised Graedric. Without thinking, Mrkos stepped in, defending the common bug and completely unaware of his connection to the noble.

                        <br><br> 

                    The mayfly introduced himself as Lurien, and Mrkos begrudgingly offered his own name in return. It was a brief meeting, but one that stuck with him more than any other.

                        <br><br>

                    When the knight Hegemol set his sights on Mrkos, the beetle did his best to avoid him whenever he could. Hegemol, however, was much faster than he seemed, considering his enormous size, and with the knight hovering over his shoulder, it was impossible for Mrkos to continue making the deals that he'd been taking in order to save for his siblings' educations. He would train Mrkos one-on-one, often leaving the beetle humiliated by the end of it, and then follow him around as if they'd known each other for years.

                        <br><br>

                    Mrkos hated it. He complained to his siblings about the knight that watched him like he was a newly-hatched larvae, and didn't think to stop himself before he revealed how he'd been making so much money despite his role as a simple guard, lamenting that Hegemol's presence now meant the end of his bribes.

                        <br><br>

                    His sister and brother were horrified by the new knowledge, and Mrkos barely had time to blink before both of them packed the little items they had and left their tiny apartment in the City of Tears, leaving their older brother behind.

                        <br><br>

                    The next time Hegemol asked him for a spar, Mrkos said no. He couldn't stay at his posts, frequently showed up late (if he showed at all), and cursed out anyone who looked at him the wrong way. And still, Hegemol remained, ignoring all attempts at shrugging him off (and quickly catching up the one time Mrkos tried to run). 

                        <br><br>

                    When Hegemol got him alone and asked how he was doing, it was the first time Mrkos had shed a tear in <i>years</i>.

                        <br><br>

                    Not to say that he had a full breakdown. He was still a city guard, and he still had to be strong, even if he wasn't sure who he was still being strong for. His misery came out more like rage, and yet Hegemol didn't say a word as Mrkos let loose. He simply stood back and let the beetle vent his frustrations, [insert whatever hegemol does after]
